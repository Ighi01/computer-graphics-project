I have not completed the new loader example yet. However, to give you more time to select the assets,
i have published the link to this shared folder before this example is available. Keey in mind that if you
start from any assignment, you should be able to read these .mgcg files, just by setting the last parameter
to MGCG, i.e.:

		Msun.init(this, &VDEmission, "models/Sphere.mgcg", MGCG);
		
When i will publish the new loader, i will also publish a new set of slides explaining normal maps, UV animations
and sky boxes, simple advanced Computer Graphics techniques that have been used in some assignments, and publish
a short video describing them.
